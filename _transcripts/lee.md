Danny Lee was born in England in 1952 and moved regularly because his father was in the Navy. He lived in Iraq after college working in computer science. He went to school for a brief period of time to be a nurse before re-entering the computer science field. He retired at the age 55 and went to school to become a massage therapist. He came out in the 1980s. He later moved to America with his partner and they both got introduced to the gay rodeo in California. He moved to Albuquerque to be with his now husband Bill and once they both were retired they moved to Palm Springs. Danny has dabbled in rodeo competition but focuses on sponsoring rodeos.
