Adam Romanik was born and raised in northeastern Pennsylvania. An avid horseman from childhood, Romanik found gay rodeo in 2009. In 2015, he organized the Keystone State Gay Rodeo Association and has served as President, hosting their first rodeo in 2017. At age 11, he had a tumor removed from his spinal cord and has been a paraplegic sinceâ€”this does not stop him from competing in many horse speed events. Romanik holds several degrees in library science and information technology, working in library virtual services management and teaches library sciences courses at the college level.
