Patrick aka Cowboy Ram became president of the Atlantic States Gay Rodeo Association. Growing up in Massachusetts and attending college in Maine, he rowed and snowboarded while young. As a fan of country music, he frequented a popular gay country western bar in Washington, DC in the early 2000s. He became involved as a way to start creating a social circle in the area. As president he sought ways to expand membership and even helped introduce drag kinging to gay rodeo royalty competitions.
