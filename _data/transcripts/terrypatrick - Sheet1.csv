,Patrick Terry,"Yes, November 25th, 1957. I celebrate my 60th birthday next month.",,
,RS,Congratulations!,,
,PT,"Yes, I am treating myself to a cruise.",,
,RS,That's gonna be amazing. So where were you born?,,
,PT,"Denver, Colorado.",childhood,
,RS,And...,,
,PT,"Born and raised on the west side, graduated from Almeida High School, and then went on to college and graduated from CU. I have a bachelors in PR and business management.",childhood,
,RS,"So the area you grew up in, was it pretty urban?",childhood,
,PT,"Yes, yes.",childhood,
,RS,Did you grow up as a city kid?,childhood,
,PT,"No. People might say I did it but I didn't 'cause even though I didn't have my own horse, I had people that had them and so I was constantly riding.",childhood,
,RS,Were you pretty horse cray as a kid?,childhood,
,PT,Yes I was. Always have been and still am.,childhood,
,RS,When did you first learn to ride?,childhood,
,PT,"Oh gosh, I would say probably about when I was about 6, 7 years old I first rode and I then I knew. I knew then, and still do, that I love it... So then, you know, through highschool, our highschool didn't offer an equine type of program like that, so I went into the program called the Westernaires, which is a professional riding, I mean kids riding group, that puts on a show for public events.  And when I was in it there was about 15, no there was about 500 people in it, and now there's 2,500.",childhood,
,RS,"Oh, wow.",childhood,
,PT,Yea.,childhood,
,RS,"And to do that, did you have to have your own horse?",childhood,
,PT,"No. And see, I was fortunate enough that my father's boss had a horse and so I was able to do it. But of the four kids, I was the only one who took an interest in doing it, and so I did it and everything else and then, you know, had my own horse for a while and then sold it for different reasons, various finacial and everything. But I always have had that passion to ride and be a part of rodeos and everything else. And so then, I came out as a gay man in 1987 and right away jumped right into it into the western lifestyle and gay rodeo and have gone on from there.",childhood;parents;comingout,
,RS,"And so, when did you first know you were gay?",comingout,
,PT,"Very interesting question, because people a lot of people will say you're born with it. I don't believe that at all. I have gone through two engagements to women and it was during my year that I travelled in Up With People, which is a singing/performing group that travels all over the world, I did that and was a staff member also one year, that I started having feelings because, you know, a lot of times we'd share, 'cause we stayed with host families wherever we went, so a lot of times we'd share a bed with another handsome man. You know, 85% of the men in Up With People are gay because its theater and production and so I started having these feelings and then I was so scared because my brother, my little brother, was gay. And it all came out when he was 16 and it wasn't good- he got caught fooling around in the park, got arrested, you know. My dad had to go bail him out. My dad bailed him out and then kicked him out of the house and wanted nothing to do with him. And so he grew up. And I have always said, he paved the path for me to be able to come out because it was so much easier for me to come out. My father never knew that I was before he passed away but my mom, I told her right away. I said, you know, this is it, I am this. ",comingout;jobs;family;parents;homophobia,
,PT,"And, I mean, my brother had seen me working at a gay bar -he came for the grand opening of this one particular bar- and I was bartending and it was kind of, kind of... not a real good thing but he, rather than talk or say anything, he goes and stands right in front of the register where I was bartending, he and his partner, all night. And so, then he brings it up at thanksgiving, that I have this. And he says you know, what's your extra job that you're doing? 'Cause at the time I was working in retail. At that time I was store, I mean department manager, for the entire mens' department of Bradburry Southwest. I had seven departments in one, 55 employees, 3 assistants, and it was a multimillion dollar business a year. It was big. I was the first one with that company to ever have multiple departments. So I was working there and doing that and then I started, you know, going to gay bars and then all of a sudden they're asking me, ""you wanna bartend?"" and everything and so I did. I went to Charlie's and in 1987, it was probably in August or September, and, right away, they were in the process of moving downtown from the Aurora area, they said, ""you wanna work here?"" and I helped put the new bar together and everything else. Which, ironically was the same place where I went to my senior highschool homecoming dinner. It used to be a restaurant called Emerson Street East. And it's ironic to go back into that building and I was bartending, DJing, waiting, bar backing, and everything.",comingout;jobs;family,
,PT,"And so, after I'd left the other bar and went on with Charlie's, then it was after that because the owner, the general manager, he was one of the founders: Wayne Jakino, he was one of the founders of IGRA and CGRA. Actually, CGRA first and then IGRA. He pushed me into getting more involved. I went to my first rodeo in Phoenix, Arizona, finals rodeo, in 1987 and had a great time and everything else, and I said, ""this is it, I want to"" so I did. And I got in. And so in 1988, I joined CGRA and from there the general manager continued to push me into a position that he had helped create for the international, which was the administrative assistant, and so I took over for a guy that got sick and eventually died of AIDs. I took over 1993, worked in the office as the administrative assistant for 10 years 'till 2003 and then resigned from that for other reasons, you know, which probably aren't so important. But I did that and have been involved basically with gay rodeo since 1988. Have been rodeo director of Denver's rodeo twice, I've been finals rodeo director, can't remember what year... 2013. How can I forget that? 2013 I was finals rodeo director in Fort Worth, Texas, and have served on various committees, not only at CGRA level but also IGRA level. I've been trustee for CGRA twice and have done other things, committees and everything else. Then in 2000... gosh, sorry can't remember, either 2013 or 2012. I think it was 12, I was inducted into the hall of fame. I found out that I was not only nominated once but twice in the same year. The first year that I was nominated I went in as into the hall of fame. It's very dear to me. It's an honor. It's, you know, means a lot. And I've served on that committee and everything else but I had to recuse myself because I was on the committee at the time I was nominated. So the chair said that I had back out of it during the process of them deciding who was gonna make it. And so, I believe it was in 2012, was at convention in Las Vegas, my rodeo mom and dad and my real mom, sister, and her husband came to it and supported me during this time of recognition and everything and so...",jobs;family,
12:12,RS,"So can I ask, going back, what year did you travel with people.",jobs,
,PT,84 and 85,jobs,
,RS,84 and 85 so it was right around there that you came out,comingout,
,PT,"It was after, basically it was towards the end of it in 85 and I was scared at first I saw what my brother had gone through and I was so scared that I stayed in the closet for 2 years before coming out in 1987",comingout,
,RS,And did anything particularly draw you to Charlie's sort of the country western side?,,
,PT,"I loved the music I loved the dancing I loved the animals and through the years I've done various things with IGRA including one of them I was score keeper for several years I did it but i didn't really I didn't like it cause it took me away from the contests and during the 10 years that I was the administrative assistant I worked directly with the contestants and that to me was the thing and so now that I've taken a couple of years of and come back today reassured me I belong with the contests not up in the both but back there so I pulled gates did the gates for the speed events for the horse contests and everybody was really excited to see me, not only see me back cause I've been gone for 2 years but that I was wanting to volunteer I said it's just I can't just sit there and watch there is no way I can go and sit in an audience and not participate",,
,RS,So at the very first rodeo you went to did you compete or did you just watch?,,
,PT,Nope I just watched,,
,RS,What did you think?,,
,PT,"I was hooked, I was hooked and ready to start competing, and started competing in 1988",,
,RS,And what events did you compete in?,events, 
,PT,"I did calf roping on foot, wild drag, steer deco, goat dressing, chute dogging, steer riding, and bull riding, and I competed from 1998 I started competing right away and I competed until I think it was about 1994 95 and then I went into the certification I was getting too old it was too hard to come back from the injuries and at that time we had 20 25 rodeos a year and sometimes we had rodeos that were back to back and so it was hard to recuperate and then go do it again but its it was something I always wanted my mother refused to come watch she I think she supported me she just didn't want to see me you know get hurt. I had my injuries I definitely did broke both collar bones almost every rip and got stepped on and you know its still. Been thinking about it when I started to get back involved with CGRA I started thinking about that I would love to one time go back and steer ride, so possible next year I'm going to do it, just do it one time just satisfy my craving for it because it just it, it is so hard to explain people ask how can you ride a bull and it's so hard to describe because it's in that moment it is the biggest thrill you could ever have and that I always said I'd never dod broncs its too high it's a lot higher up that to fall but drawback is broncs usually don't come back after you and bulls do, only thing I ever really retained I mean injury I had from bull riding was broken collarbone simple fluke fell off and landed on my shoulder and it broke. ","events, injuries",
,RS,What were those early rodeos like in the 80's,,
,PT,"Oh my gosh, very well attended, I mean you could go to the LA rodeo and I am not kidding you, there were 10 thousand people a day partying out dancing watching the rodeo all these other things and I mean it was just, we were just thriving and there were 20, 20 to 25 rodeos a years we had up to 28 associations at one time in IGRA and it was really going really strong I mean pool parties at the San Diego rodeo you just did not want to miss and so it was all this but the most important thing at all of this and I realized this after being gone for 2 years was the camaraderie and the friends. You meet friends that become your family and  you know you really do care about them it's not that I don't care about my immediate family but these people mean a lot to me, they do, and I have a lot of people yesterday and today it's wonderful to see me back and you know that truly really do love me and are excited that I'm back at",,
,RS,And you mentioned your rodeo mom and dad whose that?,family,
,PT,"Turned out to be, it was the funniest thing because I was a certified scorekeeper and at the Chicago rodeo I got invited to be the score keeper and this rodeo was on facility I mean on the grounds of this couple's home their, one of their sons lived across the driveway and everything but then they had their own full arena back there and everything else, when I first went in and met her and everything she thought I was the most pretentious queen that she'd ever seen and it was so funny but we, grew to be so close, so close I just, and when I was inducted into the hall of fame she came to Las Vegas and  she broke the news to me that she had cancer, and she fought it for about a year and passed away and it was a very very devastating to me it was very it was so hard I just can't even imagine and I, I lost my father but my father and I weren't really close after my parents divorced because I was involved with caught him cheating on her and everything and then I had to help her out when filed for divorce and moved out because she had never had a job cause she raised us 4 kids and all a sudden she's in a 5 bedroom home and had to pay utilities since he had taken out checking account",family,
,RS,How old were you when that happened?,family,
,PT,"Let's see I was... tring to think... I would say maybe, 79 or 80 1980 but still nothing ya they'd been married 28 years we had us 4 kids had [ut on this huge for them for their 25th anniversary my parents traveled through my father's business he was able to win these trips to, they traveled all over the place they went on a trip to portugal went home mom said everything was fine and then he didn't come home that night he insisted on going bowling and sure enough, I was the one who caught him doing the whole thing and that was devastating to me so after that my father and I did not speak and we had no communication with each other",family,
,RS,And when did he pass?,family,
,PT,"He passed in 1995 I think, no he passed in 1991 cause my brother passed away in 1995 of AIDs. He was, it was really interesting cause I am HIV positive myself but I am in no danger I have never been in danger because I accepted it and I dealt with it, my brother little brother was in total denial of that AIDs and him and his partner, his partner had all these holistic views about saving, so it was very difficult cause when he did get sick he was so sick he went in the hospital and 18 days later he's gone being in the hospital being fed intravenously and he's losing a pound and a half a day just deteriorating away. I had to educate my entire family on what exactly was going on, they couldn't understand how I could be HIV positive but he was in full blown AIDs, full blown AIDs, his T cell count was 5 when he went in. THey thought he had tuberculosis but then, my brother had been tested somewhere don't know exactly where but he used his social security so when he died we got the death certificate his partner really got upset because it put it in on there information they have to that he had been HIV positive for 10 years and full blown AIDs for 18 days that he was in the hospital and so you know it was really difficult so I'm educated and my family on what is going on with my brother deteriortating like that and I just had to say it but in his final days we spent a lot of time together which we had never been real close cause he always kinda despised me cause he was right behind me and I accelerated in school and he didn't and the teacher expected the same out of him that they got out of me, it was difficult, he actually attempted suicide once blaming me and so it was rough road but those probably 15 of those 18 days, him and I had a lot of talk a lot, you know, about each other and everything so at least I got to go away with that. But he, survived. ",family,
,RS,"And does your, how did your mother cope with that with the same child",family,
,PT,"She did very well and she does very well with things like that, I know deep down it was really difficult but as far as the level I was the most devastated because I was scared to death that this is what is gonna happen with me but I accepted when I found out I was HIV positive which was in 1995, yes. I was on a study for HIV negative people and my test results came back positive, and people say different things they used to say you could contract it and everything else and I know exactly what happened I know when and strictly mine the nurse was just astonished she could not belive it so she had me come in and do another blood test cause she thought it was a false positive and it turned out it wasn't but my T cells have never ever been below 500, I started taking medicine when they were between 5 and 7 hundred and I have applied, and my T cells are currently around 900 to 1100 range and so its, the disease is there it doesn't go away but you have to accept it and you have to move on with it. and I've learned and elt really good about some things that have happened in my life becoming gay coming out and becoming HIV positive I don't look at it as a bad thing it's something that's happened but with research and everything else and I participated in a lot of studies here in colorado at the University of Colorado I'm involved with studies they call me all the time and do these studies so they can work on trying to get, they're never gonna find a cure but being able to control it. I was very, excuse me, very lucky when I started taking meds AZT was very there was very little AZT in the meds and I have only in my 20 years 15 or 20 years now I have been, I've been 2 different kinds of medicine and I currently only take 2 pills a day. I take in the evening and ones a booster and the other one is and that's what has really kept me in line and through all these other medical issues that have come i have crohn's disease barrett's esophagus high cholesterol I take 38 pills a day, but you know what, it's kept me alive, it's kept me here and I have resisted that to the",family,
,RS,How do you think your rodeo family has helped through you're various health struggles?,,
,PT,"Oh I mean everybody's so supportive because, this association is very unique in we don't do rodeo for a living none of the contestants you know you can't by the time you do all your expenses and everything else throughout the year and especially if you have a horse, you go into it knowing you're gonna lose money but there's more to it than that and that's why our rodeos and the umbrella IGRA association all proceeds go back to charity, and that's we do, that's why we do this, to be able to give money back to charities.",,
,RS,"So you said earlier that you remember Wayne pretty well, what was it like working with him I heard he was very enthusiastic about, IGRA and in general, what was it like working for him?",mentor,
,PT,"He was, and he pushed and pushed and pushed me cause he did, we traveled together went to rodeos together and everything and he gave me a lot of work favors you know and everything else so that I could go to these rodeos and all these other stuff and he was just like a dad to me and, it was very devastating when he passed away, passed away from pancreatic cancer and that was very difficult once again for me but his, ideas and his creativity continues to live he's very proud I know he's very proud, I know when he died he was very proud that he had created this and watched it grow to where it got and you know we struggled in the last few years we've struggled because financially it's diccicult it's becoming more and more difficult to find sponsors because sponsors look at it as butts in the seats and we can have as many contestants as we want but its so that's the big deal and we can't our rodeos are very recreationally none of our contests make a living off of it they all have other jobs and do other things so it's very recreational but we do it because we give the money to charities and we feel good and the camaraderie that you create that you become a part of at the rodeos is it's indescribable and I found out when I had to take these last 2 years take a break, I really found out how much it really is in me and how much I missed it and I really missed the contestants and being here this weekend and being at a I was a timer ein the rodeo and I couldn't I can't just sit in those stands and watch the rodeo I got to be  doing something so I volunteered to come back behind the chutes behind the alleyway and help with the arena directors with speed events and pulling boots got me right back with the contestants because when I was a score keeper you're isolated into a different spot so you don't get that and just I miss that so much because I become so close to the contestants when I was in the office I just  become so close to them and you know, confided in them they confided in me and it really was a family and I miss that when I went up into a scorekeeper because I was isolated up there's so I I retired as a scorekeeper in 20... lets see it would have to have been about 2011 I retired and at the FLorida rodeo was my last rodeo they gave me a bifold send off and everything else and I said I'm not going away I'm just retiring and the reason I was retired was because I had been diagnosed with parkinson's and my writing was very difficult and I did not want to subject a contestant to a wrong score because the secretary or the auditor couldn't read it so I took that step but I found myself I think cause I'm ?? I like so much being with the contestants I found myself going to becoming barn manager and this turned out to be a total fluke, I had gone to the Oklahoma rodeo and I was supposed to be scorekeeper and I came in a day early and I stayed with the rodeo director and then helped him set up well he needs to go to a VIP party on the thursday night and he didn't know how he was gonna be able to do it cause these continents were starting to come in and I said I'll do it it can't be too difficult you just check their papers and give them a stall and ?? it's very simple and that really brought me back with the contestants rea;;y brought me back and so it was something I totally enjoyed and all this weekend people have said over and over and over we missed you so much and it's kinda hard to grasp I never realized it really, people really did care and do care and I;m so, it's been wonderful wonderful weekend to be back into this and I'm jumping into this and i'm jumping right back into it, course I'm not gonna be quite as involved as it was before but I've submitted my name to be back on the finals committee I told them I says I'll do anything on the committee just don't make me rodeo director again, been there done that and don't wanna go through that again cause it's not easy it's a lot of responsibility and a lot of pressure and you know with our rodeos starting to struggle in 2 thousand, probably about 2010 or 11 starting climbing and everything else it was becoming more and more difficult and fortunately the rodeo I was rodeo director of finals was wasn't as successful it was really hard for  it was really hard for me it didn't it wasn't as successful as I wanted it to be but it was happening and we're happening right now and I tried I've served on various committees probably almost very committee you could possibly think of and I've been trying to preach that with the difficult of getting sponsors and everything else we need to rather than create new associations and they jump in and do rodeo first year and they don't know what they're doing and they don't know and don't realize and they end up losing a lot of money and unfortunately some have folded and I am pushing and I'm continuing to push that associations work together, come together and we had 4 associations that were the GPR GReat PLanes ROdeo, 4 associations, Kansas Oklahoma Little Rock and Missouri and the rodeo rotated it rotated to the different cities and it worked and that was at the time when the rodeos were successful and then they eventually went off and did their won rodeos and that's what I'm trying to get back again cause we have little associations that are struggling, struggling to stay alive, stay in business and it's very disheartening when we lose one, so I;m gonna try to continue to push for the coming together not being feel like you wanna be independent do your own thing because its hard its not east and some rodeo budgets *cough* excuse me, our... finals budget can run anymore from 150 to 250 thousand dollars,budget and its hard, is very hard cause see what the contestants put in at finals they have put in a percentage all year long towards, towards the finals rodeo and then their fees for the finals rodeo itself and what's been participated this all comes into the big pot and every single event no matter how many people, how many people are in the event the payout is the same for all 13 events, equally and the n its broken down 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th I've seen bronc riders bull rider s that that's all they do their the only ones that cover and they walk away, I've seen them walk away with 3600 dollars for 2 rides but it is a big thing but even the nits becoming more and more of a struggle like I said we don't do this there's no intention of being professionals, some of our members are ??? card holders because they do other professional events roping events barrel racing you know those different things but we, ours is recreation and its more it's more than just the rodeo it's the camaraderie the chance to see friends be together spend a weekend together",mentor,

,PT,"Ya we did, PETA used to protest a lot of our rodeos so we had to deal with that but they had their limits on where they could protest and we just did not let that effect that and get to us cause we have a very strong, how would you say rules or guidelines for animal safety and we thrive on that because that it is so important to us, and part of you know the mission of IGRA and everything is for the country western lifestyle but we also want to preserve and there's no, we don't tolerate abuse of animals.",homophobia;peta,
,RS,How do you think the culture has changed overarchingly in terms of homophobia?,homophobia,
,PT,"Oh I think it's changed I think it's becoming much easier. With legal gay marriage is becoming legal now and more and more and everything its, its changed a lot and it's a lot more comfortable, and that I've always said that my brother was very difficult, because that was not that was during an era in the 70's, that it was not accepted and you had to be very careful, and there was a lot of hate and everything going on and you just really and, you know you really had to be careful and a lot of people, remained in the closet or very isolated because they were so scared. And nowadays it's much more accepted and everything else but the one thing about our rodeos too is that we have never ever, turned someone down for their race their sexual orientation, anything we have straight couples compete in our rodeos we have a couple this weekend competing and we have always with open arms invited them in and the first thing they say after they competed one day is this is unbelivable and everyone is so wonderful and so nice and they say it's a much nicer atmosphere and so we're really proud of that that we're able to bring that out into the community and open it up to anybody, and I mean we do not discriminate we're even working on now trying to get kids now involved the problems we have is the legal age and stuff like that so currently kids cannot, depending on what the legal age is the state cannot compete, but we're getting we've gone in the direction now that the associations CGRA has is we have junior members and they come to jaconos and other events that aren't sanctioned and come to the rodeos and watch their friends and or family members compete, I mean a lot of kids come that their parents are competing. It's really, it's a very gratifying very satisfying feeling and it also you know, it's just become so much easier and I said, you know, I was so blessed, to come out when I did not only did my brother pave the path with my family but my, but it also you know, it was at a time where it was getting much better and it continued to get better all the way up to today, it becomes much more acceptable there were times in the early years that we were a little fearful when we went into cities we had to be very careful, we had to be very careful, we didn't allow people to go out by themselves wwe had to be very careful because of the acceptance of being gay lesbian transgender, and I think it's, I think its continuing to become more and more acceptible, and I belive that's happening around the world as well, countries around the world that have never acknowledged women are now acknowledging women, gays are no longer being torchered and murdered for being gay, and it's a good thing, I feel very proud to be a gay man, living in the 21st century.",homophobia,

So I interviewed at the finals rodeo, no the Texas rodeo in 1992 and started January 1st 1993 for 10 years, and that was wonderful wonderful thing if I were ever to get the opportunity to go back I would do it in a heartbeat and it would be because of the contestants.",jobs,

,PT,"It was a part time job, it was, let me see how many hours was it, about 30 hours a week. And then I worked in conjunction with, working at Charlie's as a bartender, DJ and all that so my office was downstairs in the basement. So sometimes I'd come in and work up until it was time for me to go upstairs and go to work and do that but it gave an, and this is exactly what Wayne wanted, it gave an avenue for contestants to be able to go, when you couldn't necessarily go through your association because for various reasons you had an avenue to go that would help you, and I believe today it still has gone on. And Tommy Channel when he took over my position in 2003 and is currently in the position, lot of things have changed, the office is no longer there, it's all done remote, Tommy works out of his house and everything else but, and he just received on thursday, thursday night no, friday night, last night he received the Wayne Jakino, western lifestyle buckle and I've won various buckles across the year, my most favorite one is of course my hall of fame buckle, I wear that very proudly, but I wear other ones too but, that's one I do not have yet and I hope someday before I die that I will get that because Wayne paved the way for me, he pushed me into all this I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him and he was just like another a dad to me, and it just was so hard you know, it's hard to describe just how we just bonded so well.",jobs,

That was the start the was the beginning of the United States and it could have even been the beginning in other countries but it was really United States where western cowboys and indians started they were fighting against each other and then later on you know and now to this day get along and I don't know if you were there for grand entry today when they blessed that was very moving that was unbelievable i was just like wow just to be there in that and face the different directions and she would bless the directions and they all had north east south west all had meanings it was it was quite the experience I thought it was just amazing I told the person in charge of getting that that was just amazing it really was.",cowperson,
,RS,So do you consider yourself a cowboy?,cowperson,
,PT,"Yes, I always have, I always have I've always worn the jeans, the cowboy hat, everything else, and I ironically I'm the only one in my family that does, nobody else did. My father grew up on a farm in Iowa, he was basically on his own at 14 he had 10 siblings, actually he had 11 siblings initially and 2 died so then it was him and 9 siblings there are 2 of them left but he grew up there in a farm so I attribute some of the to him being that way. My mom was pure city slicker, she was born in Salt Lake City, wasn't even there a few days and was in Colorado to Colorado recognizes her as a, I am a third generation native because they recognize her as a native cause she spent most of her life here in Colorado so, yes my family comes from Fairplay area. I have a lot of relatives that are barried up in outside of Fairplay in Alma and we, when we have a death, we cremation we, we go as a family, we go up and spread the ashes the same place where we've done all the others and we've even marked a tree so we know we have the same place and it's something that our family does that just, it's just what we do and it means so much because it goes back to where our roots and were my great grandfather was and grandmother.",cowperson,
57:40:00,RS,So did you leave Charlie's at the same time you left the administrative position?,jobs,
,PT,"No, no I continued at Charlie's and worked there up until I left there in 2000 I met my partner at the time, we met by mutual friends in Puerto Vallarta hit it off right away and dated for 6 months and the I moved to Colorado Springs, he had just taken over, him and his brothers had just taken over his father's business of a 30 year painting business very reputable, they don't have to advertise because they have all these people from before that return so it's quite the deal so when my partner and I Craig talked about it, you know he said I said you know what? I'll go. I'm ready to go. I'd been in the bar business 15 years and that was it was enough, it was enough, and I just really wanted a relationship that I thought was going to be forever, unfortunately it was not but and part of it was my fault because I was so heavily involved in rodeo and travelling so much that my partner strayed and therefore, but I left 2012, moved back to Denver, lived with my friends for a year and then my Mom and I moved in together and I started taking care of her as she started getting progressing and getting older and she's getting pretty frail, and probably we're gonna have to put her into a, some kind of assisted living or nursing home in the next 6 to 8 months because it's gotten to the point I can't and she needs medical assistance. And so, once again I'll be out on my own but I'm ready to do a little bit different that typically what people do, I want to be, I worked up I just left July 22nd, I worked up the Jefferson County fairgrounds in Golden Colorado, I was the campground supervisier it was a position that this director had created with specifically with me in mind running cause he had seen how I had done when I was barn manager for CGRA rodeos and he wanted it to happen so he created the position I was there 15 months, before I had to resign because I was having medical issues and I just was worn out and also having problems with, which was my very good friend and we had become very good friends and unfortunately it clashed. But during that time I was, I had attained a trailer, a 5th wheel small 5th wheel, cause I stayed in it sometimes if we had events going over the weekends and you know gonna be that long hours and all that so I had it and with the help of  2 of my very dear friends, I was able to get that 5th wheel and did that, well during that time it convinced me that's the way I wanna live, I wanna live, I was the campground supervisor and it just was loved the people, the stories, oh my gosh people from all over the country even out the country, you know they come to camp and everything else and hearing their stories and everything else and it's becoming more and more people and not just older people, but younger people are living full time in their RVs, and so I you know of course even though I left Jefferson County fairgrounds I've been told I'm always welcome to come back and so I definitely wanna be a camp host because I can do volunteer, not have to pay rent because for volunteering its in exchange, then and I can still do the rodeos cause I'm back and I told them today, I told alot of them today, I'm not going away, I'm not going anywhere, so.",jobs,
 ,RS,So when you took the last 2 years off was that really sort of focus on your health?,,
,PT,"Partially, but partially I just needed a break, cause I had gone non-stop and you know, through losing a relationship, partially to my involvement with rodeo and commitment. Not that my commitment wasn't there but it's difficult because I traveled a lot and so then he",,
,RS,And he wasn't interested,,
,PT,"Oh no, I tried to get him interested once and boy was that the wrong thing to do, he just didn't care for that. And in the beginning he supported me completely but I just got too involved but I didn't realize until it was too late how involved I was. And so I took the 2 years just to get a break away form it but also because I was working full time up at even though it was part time it wasn't I was working very much full time but only getting paid part time, which was okay with me because of my being on disability I can only make so much a month so it wasn't the money issue it was the job and I loved it, and I would go back in a heartbeat I would go back to it, if offered that, but even if I don't I'm welcome to come back as a camp host and do that, so I'm looking forward to that, it's very unfortunate we have to do what we have to do with our mom, but it's part of it so I kinda get my independence back because it's been interesting.",,
,RS,Its difficult,,
,PT,Ya I love my mother to death but it's been tough,family,
,RS,Do your other siblings help at all?,family,
,PT,"My younger sister does, my older brother doesn't help too much but its my younger sister and I.",family,
,RS,It's a lot of work.,family,
,PT,Can we take a little break.,,
Start 2nd,RS,"Alright, we are back here with Patrick Terry and I was wondering if you would be willing to talk a little bit about the effort that went into building the amazing archive that you helped donate to the Autry National Center?",,
,PT,"I, when I was a competitor I always kept the programs I kept them myself and everything else so I had accumulated boxes, then when I went into the office, I was still competing, but you know, I was going and having access to and getting rodeo associations to send me their programs, advertising posters, everything. And I went into the office and said you know what? And it had been somewhat collected prior to that but it was mainly throw it into a box, was not organized and I you know I'm a very organized person and probably went a little overboard, I started arranging it, and then I thought you know what? This stuff is gonna come back someday it's gonna be important, someday it's gonna to be beneficial I know it will that maybe not while i'm alive but I hope that people that continue on after me will continue to collect it. So I started collecting and putting it all together organizing it get it all in order by year, by rodeo. And started doing that when I went in the office you know, heavy contacting all the associations telling them they had, weather I went to the rodeo or not I told them that they had to send me the program the advertising their flyers their posters, we used to do a poster mailout CGRA used to do a poster mailout to bars, organizations, all across the country, and each association would submit their poster and we collected, we'd get them all and then we'd put them all into tubes and mail them out, CGRA did. So we have that was going, so we had accumulated lots of posters, I'd accumulated quite a bit and you know put em up on the top shelf someday and everything else. But then when full force getting as much as I could from the rodeos and or events that the associations had put on. And it, it was fun. I loved it. And I knew that someday it would be, so then through the relationship that we built with Gregory Hinton, he came to Charlie's and we have, we were going to ship archives, well, I wanted to retain some for IGRA for the international, and so, it was kinda interesting when we met and we started going through it Gregory wanted to take it all and I wouldn't, and so Brain Helander was the president at the time and he got kinda, became the referee for, and he said, his words were Patrick is entitled to keep whatever he wants. Then whatever will go to the archives. and so Gregory wasn't to happy with me about that but it worked out. So, we went through all of it, all of it by year, I had it all in order by year we went through every single one, if there were duplicates I would keep one, one would go to them, maybe two or three. Because I was collecting about 4 to 6 programs from every rodeo and as much as a flyer and all that stuff. So I was doing all that, and so we went through all of it, 3 days, took us 2 days, 3 days.",,
,RS,And where was it stored?,,
,PT,"It was in Charlie's in the basement of the administrative IGRA office. And it was all there, in these big heavy duty shelves and I had put them all into these large really long, file boxes. And had them all in order by year, by rodeo blah blah blah. And so I had them, so by the time Gregory and I finished going through, I kept what, I felt, IGRA should have. And then we sent the others and Tommy Channel and myself drove to Erving California and... put together, I mean, sit with us we had to actually get a special... SUV large SUV, a suburban because the weight, there were 22 of those boxes full to the brim, of programs, flyers, everything you could possibly think of IGRA. And so when Gregory had approved us and said the opportunity was due it was the same time Brokeback mountain had just came out, and so the understanding we had was it was gonna go on display right away and when we arrived there I had to sign off on there, meaning it was no longer our property but theirs, and it was difficult. I had a real difficult time signing that piece of paper. I hesitated and hesitated and said you know what I don't know if I can do this. But then I kept thinking for the future of people and studying, researching as yourself, and doing this it will benifit. So I finally signed the piece of paper, I have to this day still have that piece of paper that I kept myself took a copy and put it in the archives but I kept the one I signed, to myself and, I just you know we dropped that off so we were anticipating it was gonna go on display, fairly quickly and I don't know if you've talked with Gregory in depth and everything else but at the time the Brokeback mountain the two guys shirts had been donated some guy bought them and didn't know what to do with them but he had wanted to but them, I think they said he paid 40 thousand dollars for them, so he donated them to the Autry with the understanding, that they were going to be displayed immediately, and so that's where we thought our archives were gonna go in conjunction with that and we're gonna be displayed. Unfourtunatly that didn't happen it took a few years for them to archive it and catalog it all and everything else and we had people from associations if they were in Burbank California area that they would go to, but and they never allowed, never anything was allowed to leave the Autry, it was never allowed to leave the library you checked it out but you could only do your research right there you could not take it home with you there was nothing to take. Unfortunately the archives was never really fully displayed, but there was a, like a ceremony and everything else and Mrs. Autry was there, unfortunately I wasn't able to make the event but I, it was okay, everybody knew, that I had done this, and that was probably one of the biggest highights of my entire time with IGRA. It was so gratifying, and just the whole idea that I knew someday somewhere, that it would come into play. And you know, people have researched, people have gone and researched. We did have, some of ours was on display for a while I don't know that it still is but you know, so it was a little disappointing that we anticipated i'd go farther than it did, but the fact is, it's all cataloged it's all there, at the Autry museum and Mrs. Autry was so, she could not get over, she said I have never seen any organization that kept so many things, you know? And archived them and I said... and I was. So she congratulated me on doing that and send it through people. She told me, and that to me was the top of the, here was all that it had come to fold and had come, it was now going to be put to use, rather than sitting in the boxes in the closet down at the office at Charlie's. In the basement it, but yet we still had ours.",,
,RS,"So, one thing that really struck me going through the archives was that a lot of people when they do archive rodeo things, they do flyers and they do programs but they don't do, filing of complaints, or they don't keep stock contractor agreements, they don't keep that sort of business side, and I'm wondering how you decided which of those sort of those business end of things to keep in the archive?",,
,PT,"Well I mean it was more of the how International Gay Rodeo Association Board felt about it, whether or not they wanted that released, because of people at the times, it was just starting to get better, but people's names and everything else were associated and they wanted to remain anonymous so we were, we had an obligations to our members to keep that quite, keep that as quiet as possible. So therefore it was difficult to pass on that stuff, we kept all of it, and still have it, and it's currently being stored up in a semi trailer bed that we share with the Colorado Gay Rodeo Association, the International does in storing in this big semi trailer.",,
,RS,And for the pieces you've kept that's really helped Frank Herel construct his online archive.,,
,PT,"Correct. He took it to yet another level, a level that I never even envisioned would happen, and it's just been absolutely wonderful and it's made, its brought Tom and Frank and myself so close, we are so close it's amazing because he continued, making my dream come true, and making it happen. So we still have a lot of the paperwork and everything else, but you know that basic stuff that I kept when Greg and I went through it, went over to Tom and Frank and from there Tom and Frank, Frank and I helped some, we put together, started cataloging ourselves and putting it so that we could put it on our website so people could see this, and if you go under our website you go in there you can pull up, by rodeo by year if we have the program and we have almost all of them there. We've gotten down to I think in the 20's, it might even be lower than 20 now as far as programs, people have discovered and have come forward and have given, so thats all been done and that just was, to me was, it was my dream come true, that I knew someday somehow this would be important and with technology where its gone and everything else we don't do posters very much anymore, flyers all that it's all electronic and, but we still have the programs, not always do the associations elect to do a program. But we still, if they do we still collect it and Frank archives it, and keeps it on the website and its a very, very interesting portion of the website to go to, you can get a lot of information, a lot of stuff that I learned over the years that I didn't even know occured, and finding out more and more and I'm still finding out more and more about Gay Rodeo that existed beroe CGRA or IGRA were created, that was going on, and then the big, thrown out of Reno Nevada for our finals rodeo and not being able to have that take place, after contestants were up there and ready to go and everything and it was very difficult but we managed to make that, event and or time still be part of, gay rodeo. And you know, all arounds, we that year that they couldn't have the finals rodeo they gave, at that time there were 2 divisions, and they gave the persons that had the total points both men and women division 1 division 2, their buckles as all around buckles, because the buckles had been ordered everything was in place but then they couldn't have the rodeo so did that, that's why if you look at spreadsheets that i've done for years and years and years and I still do, and I send the updated information to the announcers for the rodeos just you know, all the people that won, how many they've won by year, everything else and it took a long time to put that together I mean I had to do a lot of researching and look, and looking up stuff myself, but people love it, they love that information and it once again makes me feel so proud, to be a part of this and do this. And I'm still doing, even though these last two years I took off I still updated the information and everything else and there's a big spreadsheet that has all the women, all the men, that have ever won, all around at any rodeo and or finals, but what's interesting this year is actually the 31st... World Gar Rodeo Finals, but the one year we awarded 2 all arounds both men and women, that scews it to make it one more so there's 32 years because I felt it still needed to be recorded, and was important and, we've been working on we just celebrated the 500th rodeo, or 500th gay rodeo event. Have to be careful I say it to make sure I get it all in it wasn't just rodeos but it was other events that have taken place and I tried to keep on top of it as much as possible but then when I went from the office it was more difficult for me to keep that updated and everything else, so then another gentlemen in the last 2 years came forward, Rodger Bergman and he, went through everything and all that, now him and I still have a little bit of disagreement on which actually is the 500th rodeo, but you know, it's there, it's there it's just a matter of when, but it was decided by the board of directors and everything else that the 500th rodeo was the Bay area rodeo outside of San Francisco up in the Rushing River this year.",,
,RS,And were you able to make that one?,,
,PT,No I didn't I wasn't able to make that one this is my first rodeo besides Denver's rodeo that I've gotten back into and so.,,
20:20,RS,"So as a at home archivist, is there, like one poster or program something that you think of as your just favorite thing?",,
,PT,"You know I try, I really do but just when I think I have it, I look at another one and it's, so it's so hard for me because it brings back for me so many memories. People I have met, one of our biggest all around cowboys ever was featured on front page, I mean on the cover of the program the year the finals after he had past away and that one was my favorite for so long because I was such good friends with that gentlemen and",,
,RS,Can I ask who it was?,,
,PT,"Greg Olsen, Greg Olsen. And, I went to his memorial service and everything but, it was my favorite, and then others started coming up and you know as electronic and everything else evolved, things become fancier you know and everything else and so it's very difficult for me to really pinpoint one thing because, I can give an excuse or a give an answer to every single one of them, *laughs* and so its hard for me personally to figure out.",,
,RS,Well is there anything I haven't asked about that you want to cover?,,
,PT,"Not really I mean I just, you know, the fact that it meant so much to me and doing that project was so gratifying and I have been recognized so many years by the International for that. That was part of my getting into the hall of fame, I'm a lifetime member with CGRA. So if, it's that whole process have my involvement with IGRA or with CGRA and IGRA, is part of archives and come part of the memories that go back I share many many memories I can't even tell you how many rodeos I've gone to because there's, I can't even remember some of them because I went to so many. But its not, numbers not important to me its the fact that, the history of IGRA the International, and the archiving, that means more to me because it's beneficial, it 'll be beneficial down the road in years to come.",,
,RS,What do you think it means to young gay people to have their history documented that way?,community,
,PT,"I don't know that they really... understand archiving, I don't think they really realize it, I know I really didn't until I was older. I was 30 before I came out and so, for me I was more mature and everything the young kids I don't think they really understand archiving and the importance and everything else, they think it just happens, museums just happen this stuff happens created now I bet, it doesn't. So I would say most people, most of our young folks... don't collect like, the you know, I did and like a few others, there's another gentlemen that honest to god, his place in Arizona his name is Dan Iverson and he has collected and he has two trailers full of it, to the door, full of programs and stuff like that. He's got entire practically entire basement full of it, and everything else and he's very protective of it he doesn't like to give it up I had to beg on some of them to give to make it so that we had our archives and I was never, I've never been able to go down there and spend enough time to go through all of it cause I'm sure if I did with all of it that he has collected over the years and everything cause he was one of the right in the early years and he was actually was Greg Olsen's partner in events in the camp events for years and they were very identifiable they wore shirts with polka dots of them and they were the same in everything else, and it identified. But ya he saved his stuff and everything else but every time I've gone to his house he's been, and oh I see something and he's like umm and like please can I have just one I'm sure you've got another one, just so that we can make our's complete and he's good he's really good about it. But I've never got the opportunity to go down there and actually go through everything and I really should before, you know... too late, you know or something happens, maybe to them I don't know how long he's gonna keep those trailers full that sit on his property and all these archives these just, filing cabinet after filing cabinet after filing cabinet in the basement in his house full of all this stuff, and like I said I think we could pretty much complete it but it would take a lot of time to go through all that stuff to find, because he wasn't necessarily organized in filling it like I was, he all, kind of thrown together just so it could be, various years could be intermixed and stuff like that. Maybe someday, maybe someday, can get down there and do it but I think what we have put together, and I say we because Frank and Tom and Brian Rodgers and everyone and people that have served on the committee have spent a lot of time doing this but its all for the good of the organization and to get out and really show what we are.
