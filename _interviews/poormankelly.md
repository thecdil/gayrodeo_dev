Kelly Poorman grew up in Pennsylvania and is an active member of his church. After high school, Poorman joined the military but was not sent into active duty because he was openly gay. Instead, he became a military photographer. In the early 1990s, he began attending rodeos, joking that heâ€™d found home once he stepped in his first cowpile. Working on the arena crew and volunteering, Poorman has attended over 130 rodeos. He is also a writer and wrote a book set at the gay rodeo titled Roman and Jules.
