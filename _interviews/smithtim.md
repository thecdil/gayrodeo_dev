Tim Smith was born in Garland, Texas in 1967. He got involved with the gay rodeo, starting in 1987, through a former partner. He eventually started performing in drag and became Miss IGRA in 1994. In addition to drag performance and the charity work that comes with it, Tim competed in many rodeo events, both camp and rough stock, until 2014. He now works as an arena director and chute coordinator in addition to being the president of the Texas Gay Rodeo Association (TGRA).
