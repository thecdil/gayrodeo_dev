Marie Antoinette Du Barry grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico where he grew up more on the artistic
side of education. He came out in high school. In college, he studied historical costuming to later
incorporate that knowledge into his stage presence. As a rodeo queen, Du Barry refuses to
restrict definitions to the country western style to cowboy hats and boots.
