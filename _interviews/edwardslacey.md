Lacey Edwards calls herself an “old school lesbian” and a “rodeo girl at heart.” A Ms. AGRA 1999 and First Runner Up Ms. IGRA 2000, Lacey has competed in goat dressing and other on foot events. While she and her partner stepped back from competing when they had a child, they continued to attend events and raised their son around gay rodeo.
